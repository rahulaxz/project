This will be through achievement of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 25 September 2015. The Government of Assam is fully committed to the SDGs, and has decided to achieve all the goals in Assam by 2030, though a major all-round initiative.

    <h2>Right To Information</h2>
    <p>
        Right to Information Act 2005 mandates timely response to citizen requests for government information. An informed citizen is better equipped to keep necessary vigil on the instruments of governance and make the government more accountable to the governed. The Act is a big step towards making the citizens informed about the activities of the Government.

        <h2>Objective of RTI Act:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>To empower the citizens.</li>
            <li>To promote transparency and accountability in the working of the Government.</li>
            <li>Contain corruption, and make our democracy work for the people in real sense.</li>
        </ul>
